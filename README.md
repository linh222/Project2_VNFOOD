This is all source code we use in our data science project. First of all, we want to give a big thank to Trong Thuan and his colleagues because of their VinaFood21 dataset. We also thanks Mr. Son and Mr. Kiet a lot about observasing and helping us.

We use two datasets and three image augmentation methods for this project. Here is technical implememtations for this source:
1. Upload code to Google Colab
2. Mount to Google to connect to dataset. You can mail me if you want to get the dataset link.
3. Run code follow the structure in file.
